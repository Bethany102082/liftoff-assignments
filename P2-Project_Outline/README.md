## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My app with provide users with a check-in for church members, give them a place to log their tithes, and make annoucements to othher members at the Annual Conference.  This App will be usuaful because it will illiminate the physical check-in process which usually take 1 to 2 hours because each Pastor normally stands, introduces their memebers and reads a scripture and/or annoucements.  This idea came from my mother who is a Pastor and has to attend these Annual Conferences.
